Introduction
The SMS Management System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the management of SMS messages. It allows users to send, receive, and manage SMS communications effectively. This system is particularly useful for organizations that need to handle bulk messaging, notifications, and customer communications.

Technologies Used
Backend: Flask (Python)
Database: MongoDB (for country-operator data), MySQL (for metrics)
Frontend: React (if applicable)
Environment: Python 3.x
Tools: Postman (for testing APIs)
Installation Instructions
To set up the SMS Management System on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/divyajegan110/sms-management-system.git
cd sms-management-system
Install Required Dependencies: Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up the Database:

Create a MongoDB database for country-operator data.
Set up a MySQL database for metrics (if applicable).
Update the database connection strings in the configuration files.
Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory to store your environment variables, such as database URIs, API keys, etc.
Running the Application
To run the SMS Management System, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This command will start the Flask server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running.

API Endpoints
Here are the main API endpoints available in the SMS Management System:

Send SMS

Endpoint: POST /api/sms/send
Description: Sends an SMS message.
Request Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "phoneNumber": "string",
  "message": "string"
}
Get SMS Status

Endpoint: GET /api/sms/status/{smsId}
Description: Retrieves the status of a sent SMS.
Get Metrics

Endpoint: GET /api/metrics
Description: Fetches metrics related to sent and received SMS messages.
Testing with Postman
To test the API endpoints, use Postman by following these steps:

Download and Install Postman:

Go to Postmanâ€™s website and download the application for your operating system.
Set Up a New Request:

Open Postman and create a new request.
Select the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) for your endpoint.
Enter the URL:

Input the local server URL (e.g., http://localhost:5000/api/sms/send).
Set Headers (If Needed):

If your API requires headers, such as Content-Type, make sure to set them in the Headers tab.
Input Request Body (for POST requests):

Select the Body tab and choose raw or form-data as needed.
Enter the JSON payload for your request.
Send the Request:

Click the Send button to submit your request.
Observe the response from the server in the lower section of Postman.
Usage
Once the application is running and your API endpoints are set up, you can start sending and managing SMS messages through the defined endpoints. You can also integrate the system into your existing applications to enhance your messaging capabilities.
